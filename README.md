# yt-dlp-utils
Two CLI scripts to help make yt-dlp simpler and more user friendly.

Run `yt-music.sh` to download music as an mp3 file.
Run `yt-video.sh` to download videos as an mp4 file.

## To-dos
- [ ] add auto download yt-dlp for arch, fedora, and derivatives of the aforementioned
- [ ] add support for multiple file formats (mkv, mov, and avi) and diffrent qualities for the diffrent formats
- [x] add a playlist updater to update playlists. (can be done by rerunning the playlist link through the script and directing it to the right folder)
